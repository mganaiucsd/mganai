### a bit about me
Hi! I'm **Milan Ganai**, and I'm majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.

*I enjoy:*
- Traveling
- Trying new foods
- Going to the beach

And here's my beagle, Dunkin.

*Dunkin loves:*
1. Wiggling in excitement
2. Going on long walks 
3. Snoring loudly

in that order.

And his daily task list includes:
- [X] `dunkin.run_on_grass(wildy=True)`
- [X] `dunkin.get_belly_rubs()`
- [ ] `dunkin.nap()`

## programming stuff

It was once said by Linus Torvalds:
> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

So here's the code:
```
for _ in range(100):
    print("THE CODE")
```

As random trivia, [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) is an external link to the *first* web page address.

Also if you haven't seen it, [here](#intro-about-me) is the previous section on an intro about me.

Even more, [here](./screenshots/ScreenShotCommandLine.png) is relative link to an image of terminal commands.
