*Dunkin loves:*
1. Going on long walks 
2. Snoring loudly
3. Wiggling in excitement

in that order.

And his daily task list includes:
- [X] `dunkin.run_on_grass(wildy=True)`
- [X] `dunkin.get_belly_rubs()`
- [ ] `dunkin.nap()`

### programming stuff

It was once said by Linus Torvalds:
> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

So here's the code:
```
for _ in range(100):
    print("THE CODE")
```

As random trivia, [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) is the web page address.
