Hi! I'm **Milan Ganai**, and I'm majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.
*I enjoy:*
- Traveling
- Trying new food
- Going to the beach

Here's a pic of my beagle, Dunkin.

*Dunkin loves:*
1. Going on long walks 
2. Snoring loudly
3. Wiggling in excitement

in that order.

It was once said by Linus Torvalds:
> Talk is cheap, show me the code.

So here's some code testing:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    System.out.println("Random Code Test.");
}
```
