### intro about me
Hi! I'm **Milan Ganai**, and I'm majoring in Computer Science at UCSD.
*I enjoy:*
- Traveling
- Trying new food
- Going to the beach

Here's a pic of my beagle, Dunkin.

*Dunkin loves:*
1. Going on long walks 
2. Snoring loudly
3. Wiggling in excitement

in that order.

And his daily ~~coding~~ task list is:
- [X] wildy running at the sight of grass
- [X] getting belly rubs
- [ ] sleep

### programming stuff

It was once said by Linus Torvalds:
> Talk is cheap, show me the code.

So here's some code testing:
```
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    System.out.println("Random Code Test.");
}
```

As random trivia, [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) is the web page address.

Also if you haven't seen it, [here](#intro-about-me) is the previous section on an intro about me.

Even more, [here](./screenshots/ScreenShotCommandLine.png) is an image of terminal commands.
